Description

Kitchen Table is an application that allows users to create an inventory and track the food found in their kitchen. Users will be asked to enter their foods manually and then will be stored in their online pantry. After those items are stored, the application will look for recipes in a database given the food filtered through tags, so the user can choose their preference on types of recipes. The application will also allow the user to save missing foods to their grocery list in case theyâ€™re offline.
